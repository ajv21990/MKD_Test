## MK Decision Test
This was my attempt at the coding challenge given to me by MK Decision. I've never used any Amazon cloud services before so the fact that I was able to accomplish the majority of this test in the allotted  leaves me feeling good about myself. The challenge itself had me design a form using Material UI and take the form’s message and send it to Amazon’s DynamoDB. The app was also supposed to send an email to the email specified in the form using SES. The final step was uploading the project to an S3 bucket and deploying the site. I was able to achieve everything but using SES to send an email. The issue I had occured when I tried to test my app in API Gateway and even though the Lambda test worked and returned a 200, the API Gateway test kept returning a 500. I tried to fix the issue with Google searches and Youtube tutorials but alas I could’n figure it out. I also had an issue where the emails sent in my tests were never delivered due to my emails being unauthenticated from yahoo (I was sending them to a Google account) even though both emails were Amazon SES verified. Overall I had a fun, sometimes a little  frustrating, experience working with this project. For the first time diving into AWS services I think I did a great job.
